"""The authenticated caller — the single currency between auth and handlers.

Both /mcp tools and the REST routers receive a Principal and never a raw
token. Unlike the mcp-template reference design (which maps an external IdP's
claims through a shared `from_claims` function), mural-mcp mints its own
personal access tokens: a verified token already resolves directly to a
stored User + PersonalAccessToken record, so there is no generic
claims-to-identity mapping step to centralise here. `Principal` is just the
shape both surfaces build, in one place each, once they have that record —
see app.infra.auth.personal_token (MCP) and
app.infra.rest.auth.resolver (REST).
